## The Overﬁtted Brain: Dreams evolved to assist generalization

- [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09560)

Abstract:
- claims:
  > "The goal of this paper is to argue that the brain faces a similar challenge of overﬁtting, and that nightly dreams evolved to combat the brain’s overﬁtting during its daily learning. That is, dreams are a biological mechanism for increasing generalizability via the creation of corrupted sensory inputs from stochastic activity across the hierarchy of neural structures. Sleep loss, speciﬁcally dream loss, leads to an overﬁtted brain that can still memorize and learn but fails to generalize appropriately."
